Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

You can see my demo in the given demo link at the top
-   What was your experience?
I was hard to create lots of input with only one component.

I learnt when we want to change the color of the border when focusing the input, we must take the outline out.
